# Embracing the Extremes of Virtue and Vice

---

In a world where being 'mid' is the easy path, it's time to challenge the norm.

## The Dilemma of the Mid

Most people strive for balance, walking a tightrope between good and bad. But is this balance truly fulfilling? Or is it just a safe path, devoid of the highs and lows that give life its flavor?

1. Be anything else,
2. Be virtuous,
3. Be devilish,
4. Better yet,
5. be both,

> Never be neither. Neither is the way of the mid.

### Why Not Mid?

Being mid, or average, often means missing out on the essence of life. It's a lukewarm existence, devoid of passion. Mom, and perhaps the universe, urges you not to settle for this.

> Donâ€™t be mid. Mom will be sad, if you are a mid.

## The Virtue in Vice and Virtue

### The Path of Virtue

Living a life of virtue is noble. It's about contributing positively to the world, upholding moral values, and finding contentment in goodness.

### The Temptation of Vice

Conversely, a life led with a touch of devilishness is equally fascinating. It's about indulging in the world's temptations, embracing your desires, and experiencing life's guilty pleasures.

### The Best of Both Worlds

Why not blend these extremes? Embrace both the light and the dark within you. It's not about being reckless; it's about acknowledging that life is multifaceted.

> Better yet, be both, cause fun, but just dont be mid.

## Conclusion: The Art of Being Unapologetically You

In the end, the message is clear: Be unapologetically you, whether that's virtuous, devilish, or a mix of both. Just don't be mid. Life's too short for that.
